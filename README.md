Car Suspension
Car Suspension Car Suspension To simulate the behavior of a car suspension system when the car is driven over an obstacle. Different situations, for example when the speed or the loading of the car changes was examined. A simplified model of a car suspension system is shown in 'Car Suspension Overview' file. The quarter of the car body mass (M) is taken into consideration but the half of the axle mass together with the mass of the wheels is neglected. Newton's law in conjunction with laplace transform was applied to obtain a transfer function which was implemented in MATLAB Simulink

Positioning System 
Position System Examined the control system used for positioning in a machine tool . Fine tuning and observing the behavior of the system to adjust the parameters accordingly. Kirchoff's law, Ohms law and servomechanism modelling were used to obtain the transfer function

Torpedo 
Control system used to stabilise the response of the torpedo to a step change in depth setting. Tuned the system parameters to obtain a satisfactory response. Simulink model was designed, neglecting the gravity effects.

'Torpedo_3' file was used for trail and approach 
'storpedo' file simulates the non-linear system 
'Torpedo.m' is the main file
