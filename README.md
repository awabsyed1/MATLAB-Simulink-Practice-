Torpedo 

Control system used to stabilise the response of the torpedo to a step change in depth setting. Tuned the system parameters to obtain a satisfactory response. 
Simulink model was designed, neglecting the gravity effects.

'Torpedo_3' file was used to trail and approach 
'storpedo' file simulates the non-linear system 
'Torpedo.m' is the main file
